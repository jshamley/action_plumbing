<br><br>

A very special thank you! to Dick and his crew for an emergency rescue. Their consideration and efficiency were outstanding!<br><br>
<p align="right">~ Sharon Wherry</p>

I called your company a few days ago in a bit of desperation.  I had hired a contractor who had walked off the job taking all the materials for my bathroom with him.  Your company came out at no charge to look at what I had been left with.  Today, one of your staff came to do a little bit of work (raising a shower head).  I must admit I was completely shocked.  He was so very kind, incredibly fast and a solid professional. What a difference from the previous contractor!<br><br>

To add to my amazement, I asked him how much he was going to charge me and just smiled at me gently and said, "We will send you a bill".  I know I was standing there with my mouth open, I mean after all, the contractor I had been dealing with had held his hand out even when the work wasn't done.  Every other plumber I called would not even talk to me unless I paid them upfront for a visit.  After he left, I sat here thinking, if only I had hired your firm in the first place!<br><br>

I cannot thank you enough for coming out and reviewing the existing rough installation.  Every other company I called wanted 80 or more dollars just to come see what I had.  Instead you came in your kindness, told me my installation was ok and answered (very patiently) my questions.  I WILL have you back to do the finish installation and I know who I will be calling when we begin the major remodeling (if I can just get my husband to commit to a date!!) of my Kitchen.<br><br>

Once again, thank you so very much for your kindness.  You restore my faith in good craftsmen!<br><br>

Hi Dick,<br><br>

Your company really helped us when we were in a bind.<br><br>

We just wanted to let you know that Stephanie, Everett and Ari did a fantastic job for us the other day when the hot water heaters went out at our apartment complex.<br><br>

Stephanie was prompt and courteous. Our manager Gene said that Everett and Ari were very efficient and professional.<br><br>

You have a great group of people working with you. If you could share these cookies with them, that would be great.<br><br>

Everett did a wonderful job when repairing my hose bibb. Everett was very personable and went the extra mile. I talked to him about having the sprinkler tap drained recently and how and asked how I could tell if they did a good job. He said how important it was to have it done properly and that he would check it and get right back to me. Within a very few minutes he said it was just fine. The experience was so positive that Action Plumbing & Heating will have a customer for life!<br><br>

Thank you so much for helping us out with our problem on Stover. We appreciate your quick response on such short notice and squeezing us in. That's the reason we have stuck with Action and Dick Zastrow for the past 25 years!<br><br>

Thank you,<br><br>

To everyone at Action Plumbing & Heating - We just want to thank you once again for the work you did to install our new tankless water heater and remove our old one. Working with you has been a pleasure. Your staff has been pleasant, knowledgeable and easy to work with. We were happy with the workmanship, as well as the price. We will gladly recommend you whenever possible. Thank you!<br><br>

Dear Stephanie, Dick, & crew<br><br>

Thank you SO MUCH for the prompt attention you gave my plumbing problems!!! I could not have asked for better service!!<br><br>

I was "more than impressed" that you responded as rapidly as you did when I was a "first time customer". Then, not only did you give me EXCELLENT service on the first major problem I had, but you came right back and helped solve the problem that I was having with my kitchen drain!!! And...... you didn't seem to be too worried about whether or not I would be able to pay you!<br><br>

Thank you again! Your service was GREAT!!!!<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>
